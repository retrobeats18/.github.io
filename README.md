This is Jordan Strickland's personal porfolio website. This is a compilation of what I have learned in the Front End Web Development Program at Udacity.com. All images were shot with an iphone6 and edited by me. This site uses the Bootstrap framework and alot of the styling options available through the documentation on their website here (http://getbootstrap.com/).
